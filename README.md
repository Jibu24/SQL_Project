# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
- Main objective was to transform raw, unformatted ecommerce data to a more organized and readable manner so we could perform simple analysis using SQL

## Process
### 1. Import data in csv file into SQL database using the correct column constraints and data types
### 2. Clean and format data into more recognizable manner for analysis
### 3. Perform data analysis allowed by SQL queries
### 4. Perform QA measures to ensure results obtained during analysis is accurate

## Results
1. San Francisco, Sunnyvale, Atlanta and Palo Alto were the highest revenue generating cities
2. United, States, Israel, Australia and Canada were the highest revenue generating countries
3. Ballpoint LED pen, Google 17oz stainless steel sport bottle and Leatherette Journal were among the top 3 revenue generating products
4. The month of July had the most revenue generating sales
5. The month of August had the least revenue
6. Total revenue increased 122 % from year 2016 to 2017

## Challenges 
1. Lack of Domain Knowledge
    - Had a hard time figuring out what some of the columns represented
        - i.e the difference between "revenue" and "transactionrevenue"
2. Data was volouminess 
    - Trying to make sense of and relate data between tables containing so many columns was no easy task
3. With such a volouminess data, there were numerous columns containing duplicate or NULL values that would significantly alter the results obtained during analysis
    - Would require lots more hours to try and filter them out
    

## Future Goals
If I had more time the first thing I would do is perform more data cleaning to filter out the NULL and duplicate values. Secondly I would ask more questions about what I can do with the data; such as which product had the highest refund percentage or is the monthly revenue data consistent with previous years etc. Lastly I implement an even more thorough QA process.
