# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
- Main objective was to transform raw, unformatted ecommerce data to a more organized and readable manner so we could perform simple analysis using SQL

## Process
### 1. Import data in csv file into postgresql database using the correct column constraints and data types
### 2. Clean and format data into more recognizable manner for analysis
### 3. Perform data analysis allowed by SQL queries
### 4. Perform QA measures to ensure results obtained during analysis is accurate

## Results
1. 

## Challenges 
1. Lack of Domain Knowledge
    - Had a hard time figuring out what some of the columns represented
        - i.e the difference between "revenue" and "transactionrevenue"
2. Data was volouminess 
    - Trying to make sense of and relate data between tables containing so many columns was no easy task
3. With such a volouminess data, there were numerous columns containing duplicate or NULL values that would significantly alter the results obtained during analysis
    - Would require lots more hours to try and filter them out
    

## Future Goals
If I had more time the first thing I would do is perform more data cleaning to filter out the NULL and duplicate values. Secondly I would ask more questions about what I can do with the data; such as which product had the highest refund percentage or is the monthly revenue data consistent with previous years etc. Lastly I implement an even more thorough QA process.
